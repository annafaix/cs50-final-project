# My CS50 final project - FridgeCon

**"Did you also bought milk?"**

*-said nobody using FridgeCon or his/hers roommate* :wink:

## Introduction
FridgeCon is a Flask application using SQL database, where is possible to store, update and delete items in "the fridge". 
Google OAuth is used to handle the registration of a new user and login.

Every item in the list has a name, date when it was bought, amount which can be updated and unit. The cathegory of the product is shown by border of the item (blue for dairy product, green for vegetable and fruit, etc.).
When you took the last milk in the morning, just click on "add to shopping list". There you see a list of items you need to buy. This list can be printed out, or send to an email adress (need further development).

## Requirements
    Jinja 2.11.12+
    Flask 1.1.2+

## Framework
    SemanticUIi@2.4.2
    Bootstrap@5.0.0
